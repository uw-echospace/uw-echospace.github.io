Therefore, understanding which environmental conditions have an impact on bat activity, and to what extent, is critical to developing effective conservation strategies in one region.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With the Union Bay Natural Area at the University of Washington as a research site, using bat echolocation call detections from the
&lt;a href="https://uw-echospace.github.io/project/2022-ubna-pam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UBNA passive acoustic monitoring program&lt;/a>, meteorological data from the University of Washington weather station, and lunar phase data from NASA, the project aims to find the environmental factors that influence bat activity and explore the effects of extreme stormy weather on local bat emergence through statistical testing and inference.&lt;/p>

Although much has already been studied in laboratory experiments, technology has just started catching up to allow researchers to study echolocation-related processes in the wild. Advancements in passive acoustic monitoring tools have made it affordable to conduct long-term acoustic surveys on animals in the wild. Echolocators, like bats, are well-suited for monitoring using simple passive acoustic techniques because of their use of acoustics and navgitaion in air.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this project, we sought to collect long-term acoustic data using Audiomoths from an urban natural area called the Union Bay Natural Area at the University of Washington. With this data, we hope to uncover questions on how environmental conditions influence how bats choose to forage.&lt;/p>

Echosounders, or fish-finders, are high-frequency sonar systems that emit pulses of sound and record the reflections from animals, the seabed, and other objects. These instruments have been proven to be more efficient and effective for collecting data over a large survey area or a long time period than many other sampling methods, such as underwater imaging and net trawls. This technology has been widely adopted by the ocean science and commercial fishing communities and more recently has been integrated with autonomous vehicles, resulting in a massive amount of data. However, these datasets can be difficult to analyze and are often underutilized. We will address this issue by adopting and advancing data standards, developing a streamlined data processing workflow, and integrating open-source software tools that capitalize on recent advancements in cloud computing technologies to efficiently transform large quantities of ocean sonar data into information that is useful for exploring, monitoring, and managing living marine resources.&lt;/p>

The development of this software has been primarily focused on surveys targeting Pacific hake (&lt;strong>see below information for more details&lt;/strong>), but the goal is to generalize the software in the future for broader fisheries community use.&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/about/northwest-fisheries-science-center" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC)&lt;/a> collaborates with
&lt;a href="https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/index-eng.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) - Pacific Region&lt;/a> to estimate total biomass of
&lt;a href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/species/pacific-whiting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pacific hake (&lt;i>Merluccius productus&lt;/i>)&lt;/a> by incorporating acoustic and biological trawl data from the

&lt;p>These biomass estimates are the inputs for the stock assessment of hake and need to be completed in an efficient and timely manner after the survey. The biomass estimates are currently produced by a suite of Matlab scripts operated by a single user, and the analysis procedures are not easily adaptable by other FEAT/DFO team members. The central objective of this project is to provide a well-documented open-source
&lt;a href="https://github.com/OSOceanAcoustics/echopop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Python software package&lt;/a> (&lt;code>echopop&lt;/code>) that contains the core computational functionality of the current Matlab EchoPro program and provides basic visualization of the analysis results.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The new software package (currently
&lt;a href="https://github.com/OSOceanAcoustics/echopop/releases/latest" target="_blank" rel="noopener">version 0.4.0&lt;/a> and available on
&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/echopop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PyPi&lt;/a>) contains an expanded
&lt;a href="https://echopop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">documentation&lt;/a> that details the underlying theory and algorithmic implementation that help facilitate reproducibility. Other features include an
