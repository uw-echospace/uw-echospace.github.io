Over the past three decades, a wide suite of physics-based acoustic scattering models were developed to allow translating acoustic observations to biological quantities, such as biomass and abundance, for different marine organisms. In parallel, quantitative scientific echosounders have progressed from specialized equipment to one of the standard instruments on fisheries survey vessels.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To take full advantage of these large and complex new datasets, in this project we aim to combine the development of machine learning methodology with a cloud-based workflow to accelerate the extraction of biological information from fisheries acoustic data. This project is in close collaboration with the

However, our understanding of these animals, particularly those in the pelagic zones, is severely limited, due to the lack of tools that cab . This gap of knowledge has greatly impeded our ability in making informed policy decisions to support sustainable resource management. The root cause of this problem is the lack of tools that can collect information about these animals at large temporal and spatial scales comparable to other physical, chemical, and lower-trophic biological (e.g., chlorophyll) oceanographic variables.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Gliders have provided unparalleled mobile, persistent access to deep, remote ocean environments at a fraction of the cost of a research vessel. Taking advantage of this unique capability, in this project we aim to develop sampling strategies and data analysis methodologies to enable distributed long-term observation of mid-trophic marine organisms using

Blind expert human echolocators prove that this capacity does not depend exclusively on biological specializations unique to particular species. This project is an integrated component of a larger collaborative project (see funding below) focused on active sensing in echolocating marine mammals and humans. The overarching goal of the interdisciplinary team is to use both toothed whales (odontocetes) and humans as model systems to identify the neural mechanisms that extract echo-acoustic information and the brain networks that build robust, invariant representations of auditory objects in complex auditory scenes. The UW-APL component of the project involves modeling the echolocation-based target search by toothed whales as an information-seeking behavior by extending the &lt;em>infotaxis&lt;/em> algorithm originally formulated in moth odor tracking problems into an &lt;em>active sensing&lt;/em> context. In parallel with the theoretical work, we also conducted an echolocation target discrimination experiment with a harbor porpoise to guide further model development.&lt;/p>
