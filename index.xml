Over the past three decades, a wide suite of physics-based acoustic scattering models were developed to allow translating acoustic observations to biological quantities, such as biomass and abundance, for different marine organisms. In parallel, quantitative scientific echosounders have progressed from specialized equipment to one of the standard instruments on fisheries survey vessels.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To take full advantage of these large and complex new datasets, in this project we aim to combine the development of machine learning methodology with a cloud-based workflow to accelerate the extraction of biological information from fisheries acoustic data.

Echosounders, or fish-finders, are high-frequency sonar systems that emit pulses of sound and record the reflections from animals, the seabed, and other objects. These instruments have been proven to be more efficient and effective for collecting data over a large survey area or a long time period than many other sampling methods, such as underwater imaging and net trawls. This technology has been widely adopted by the ocean science and commercial fishing communities and more recently has been integrated with autonomous vehicles, resulting in a massive amount of data. However, these datasets can be difficult to analyze and are often underutilized. We will address this issue by adopting and advancing data standards, developing a streamlined data processing workflow, and integrating open-source software tools that capitalize on recent advancements in cloud computing technologies to efficiently transform large quantities of ocean sonar data into information that is useful for exploring, monitoring, and managing living marine resources.&lt;/p>

These biomass estimates are the inputs for the stock assessment of hake and need to be completed in an efficient and timely manner after the survey. The biomass estimates are currently produced by a suite of Matlab scripts operated by a single user, and the analysis procedures are not easily adaptable by other FEAT/DFO team members. The central objective of this project is to provide a well-documented open-source Python software package that contains the core computational functionality of the current Matlab EchoPro program and provides basic visualization of the analysis results. The new software package will contain an Application Programming Interface (API) that can be invoked in a reproducible manner and can accept configuration of key analysis parameters and other run-time setups via a machine and human-readable configuration file.&lt;/p>

To take advantage of the recent technological advances in collecting acoustic data via platforms different from the traditional ship-based systems, such as uncrewed marine systems (UxSs), we need to seek alternative strategies that can provide crucial biological information.

This work will involve the integration of the AT, BT, and OP biological data from 2003 to 2019 into a NWFSC-hosted database with a unified format. This will enable the quantitative evaluation of similarities and differences among the three data sources and assessment of the associated variability. The resulting software and workflow will facilitate the integration of all three data sources into a unified format and enable research to answer two important questions: (1) Can we use biological data from alternative sources to provide effective and satisfactory biomass estimates or biomass indices for UxSs-based acoustic surveys? (2) Can we extract new biological information on hake by analyzing the integrated fishery–dependent (OP) and fishery–independent (AT and BT) data?&lt;/p>

However, our understanding of these animals, particularly those in the pelagic zones, is severely limited, due to the lack of tools that cab . This gap of knowledge has greatly impeded our ability in making informed policy decisions to support sustainable resource management. The root cause of this problem is the lack of tools that can collect information about these animals at large temporal and spatial scales comparable to other physical, chemical, and lower-trophic biological (e.g., chlorophyll) oceanographic variables.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Gliders have provided unparalleled mobile, persistent access to deep, remote ocean environments at a fraction of the cost of a research vessel.

Blind expert human echolocators prove that this capacity does not depend exclusively on biological specializations unique to particular species. This project is an integrated component of a larger collaborative project (see funding below) focused on active sensing in echolocating marine mammals and humans. The overarching goal of the interdisciplinary team is to use both toothed whales (odontocetes) and humans as model systems to identify the neural mechanisms that extract echo-acoustic information and the brain networks that build robust, invariant representations of auditory objects in complex auditory scenes. The UW-APL component of the project involves modeling the echolocation-based target search by toothed whales as an information-seeking behavior by extending the &lt;em>infotaxis&lt;/em> algorithm originally formulated in moth odor tracking problems into an &lt;em>active sensing&lt;/em> context. In parallel with the theoretical work, we also conducted an echolocation target discrimination experiment with a harbor porpoise to guide further model development.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>Share your successes and excitements with the group&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Respect other people&amp;rsquo;s time&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Acknowledge contributions from others&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ensure everyone has the opportunity to participate and talk both online and in person&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Give opportunities to others to speak first&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It is ok to disagree, but not disrespect&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid to make mistakes&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Be comfortable reaching to other members for career/academic advice, this is part of peer mentoring&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid to ask questions or answer others' questions. Unexpected obstacles can always come up: try to understand and help someone deal with their obstacle individually (but not taking away their work from them!)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Be comfortable bringing up issues or obstacles that hold you back from getting work done&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Make accommodations for personal emergencies&lt;/li>
