Therefore, understanding which environmental conditions have an impact on bat activity, and to what extent, is critical to developing effective conservation strategies in one region.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With the Union Bay Natural Area at the University of Washington as a research site, using bat echolocation call detections from the
&lt;a href="https://uw-echospace.github.io/project/2022-ubna-pam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UBNA passive acoustic monitoring program&lt;/a>, meteorological data from the University of Washington weather station, and lunar phase data from NASA, the project aims to find the environmental factors that influence bat activity and explore the effects of extreme stormy weather on local bat emergence through statistical testing and inference.&lt;/p>

Although much has already been studied in laboratory experiments, technology has just started catching up to allow researchers to study echolocation-related processes in the wild. Advancements in passive acoustic monitoring tools have made it affordable to conduct long-term acoustic surveys on animals in the wild. Echolocators, like bats, are well-suited for monitoring using simple passive acoustic techniques because of their use of acoustics and navgitaion in air.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this project, we sought to collect long-term acoustic data using Audiomoths from an urban natural area called the Union Bay Natural Area at the University of Washington. With this data, we hope to uncover questions on how environmental conditions influence how bats choose to forage.&lt;/p>
