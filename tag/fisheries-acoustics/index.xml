The new program BOAT: Bridge to Ocean Acoustics and Technology will develop open source education curriculum&amp;amp;tutorials and interactive training workshops that aim to prepare students from diverse backgrounds (biology, physics, electrical engineering, math, etc) for doing research in the interdisciplinary field of Ocean Acoustics. The modules will cover topics ranging from the scientific theory (physics) of scattering of the seabed and marine organisms, practical applications in oceanography and fisheries, to foundational topics in statistics, machine learning, and data science workflows which all are indispensable in navigating todayâ€™s data-rich science. They will be provided in the form of
&lt;a href="https://ebooks.iospress.nl/publication/42900" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jupyter Notebooks&lt;/a> with interactive components, which can be adapted and ingested in various settings such as a university course or a summer workshop, and will serve as blueprints for building resources on other ocean acoustics topics. The goal is to build a community of practitioners who build and share knowledge on best practices on how to teach and train new scientists in the field.

Over the past three decades, a wide suite of physics-based acoustic scattering models were developed to allow translating acoustic observations to biological quantities, such as biomass and abundance, for different marine organisms. In parallel, quantitative scientific echosounders have progressed from specialized equipment to one of the standard instruments on fisheries survey vessels.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To take full advantage of these large and complex new datasets, in this project we aim to combine the development of machine learning methodology with a cloud-based workflow to accelerate the extraction of biological information from fisheries acoustic data. Our group has developed and used
&lt;a href="https://echopype.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Echopype&lt;/a>, a Raw Sonar Backscatter data parsing Python package, and
&lt;a href="https://echoregions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Echoregions&lt;/a>, an Echoview annotation data parsing Python package. Transferring data from Echoview and proprietary echosounder formats to Python data products enables seamless integration with a rich ecosystem of scientific computing tools developed by a vast community of open-source contributors, thus allowing us to use our data to train deep learning models to predict regions of interest in echograms.&lt;/p>

Echosounders, or fish-finders, are high-frequency sonar systems that emit pulses of sound and record the reflections from animals, the seabed, and other objects. These instruments have been proven to be more efficient and effective for collecting data over a large survey area or a long time period than many other sampling methods, such as underwater imaging and net trawls. This technology has been widely adopted by the ocean science and commercial fishing communities and more recently has been integrated with autonomous vehicles, resulting in a massive amount of data. However, these datasets can be difficult to analyze and are often underutilized. We will address this issue by adopting and advancing data standards, developing a streamlined data processing workflow, and integrating open-source software tools that capitalize on recent advancements in cloud computing technologies to efficiently transform large quantities of ocean sonar data into information that is useful for exploring, monitoring, and managing living marine resources.&lt;/p>

The development of this software has been primarily focused on surveys targeting Pacific hake (&lt;strong>see below information for more details&lt;/strong>), but the goal is to generalize the software in the future for broader fisheries community use.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>These biomass estimates are the inputs for the stock assessment of hake and need to be completed in an efficient and timely manner after the survey. The biomass estimates are currently produced by a suite of Matlab scripts operated by a single user, and the analysis procedures are not easily adaptable by other FEAT/DFO team members. The central objective of this project is to provide a well-documented open-source
&lt;a href="https://github.com/OSOceanAcoustics/echopop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Python software package&lt;/a> (&lt;code>echopop&lt;/code>) that contains the core computational functionality of the current Matlab EchoPro program and provides basic visualization of the analysis results.&lt;/p>
