&lt;p>In this project, we deploy low-cost
&lt;a href="https://www.openacousticdevices.info/audiomoth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AudioMoth&lt;/a> recorders at multiple sites in the
&lt;a href="https://botanicgardens.uw.edu/center-for-urban-horticulture/visit/union-bay-natural-area/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Union Bay Natural Area&lt;/a>, right on the eastern edge of the University of Washington, Seattle campus. Since the project began in fall 2021, we have collected over 30 TB of recordings that are embedded with sounds from a wide variety of animals (e.g., birds, bats, frogs) and anthopogenic sources (e.g., airplanes, football stadium roars).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Beyond generating a rich dataset, the project fieldwork and data analysis provides an accesible entry point for students to engage in real-world bioacoustics research, with hands-on data science and instrumentation opportunities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have leveraged this dataset to investigate the
&lt;a href="https://uw-echospace.github.io/talk/202405-aditya-duty-cycle/">impact of duty cycle recording on bat monitoring&lt;/a> and support multiple capstone projects in the
&lt;a href="https://www.washington.edu/datasciencemasters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UW Data Sciene Master&amp;rsquo;s Program&lt;/a>, focused on developing open-source, cloud-hosted workflows for analyzing large PAM datasets. With these tools in place, going forward we plan to characterize the seasonal soundscape fluctuations in UBNA with respect to weather/climate events, and find opportunities to expand this effort to a community monitoring program in the Greater Seattle area.&lt;/p>

These animals have the remarkable ability to detect and track small targets over long distance and discriminate between minute differences between targets using echolocation, with performance often surpassing that of current human-made sonar systems. However, many questions remain in how exactly the unusual anatomical structures in the head of toothed whales are orchestrated to support such performance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As part of a Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative (MURI) project, we use finite element modeling techniques in combination with volumetric representations derived from computed tomography (CT) scans to predict the head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) of a dolphin head. The HRTFs summarizes the influence of the head to sounds propagating to the ears. We use HRTFs as a biologically meaningful proxy to provide a physics-based mechanistic understanding of the sound transduction processes.&lt;/p>

Blind expert human echolocators prove that this capacity does not depend exclusively on biological specializations unique to particular species. This project is an integrated component of a larger collaborative Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative (MURI) project focused on active sensing in echolocating marine mammals and humans. The MURI team use both toothed whales (odontocetes) and humans as model systems to identify the neural mechanisms that extract echo-acoustic information and the brain networks that build and learn robust, invariant representations of auditory objects in complex auditory scenes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In Echospace, we undertake two interconnected components of this project:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Model the echolocation-based target search by toothed whales as an information-seeking behavior by extending the &lt;em>infotaxis&lt;/em> algorithm originally formulated in moth odor tracking problems into an &lt;em>active sensing&lt;/em> context&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;li>Conduct and analyze the coupled acoustic sampling and movement behaviors of an echolocating harbor porpoise in a target discrimination experiment&lt;/li>
