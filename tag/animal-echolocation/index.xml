The proposed models will help elucidate the complex acoustic pathways that play a crucial role in the ability of these marine mammals to locate and track prey, communicate with conspecifics, and avoid potential threats in their environment. We intend to employ a range of analytical and computational techniques to model the sound propagation and reception in the auditory systems of toothed whales, which will provide valuable insights into their hearing capabilities. The ultimate goal of this research is to enhance our knowledge of the sensory systems of toothed whales, which could have significant implications for their conservation and management in the wild, as well as for the development of innovative technologies inspired by nature.&lt;/p>

Blind expert human echolocators prove that this capacity does not depend exclusively on biological specializations unique to particular species. This project is an integrated component of a larger collaborative project (see funding below) focused on active sensing in echolocating marine mammals and humans. The overarching goal of the interdisciplinary team is to use both toothed whales (odontocetes) and humans as model systems to identify the neural mechanisms that extract echo-acoustic information and the brain networks that build robust, invariant representations of auditory objects in complex auditory scenes. The UW-APL component of the project involves modeling the echolocation-based target search by toothed whales as an information-seeking behavior by extending the &lt;em>infotaxis&lt;/em> algorithm originally formulated in moth odor tracking problems into an &lt;em>active sensing&lt;/em> context. In parallel with the theoretical work, we also conducted an echolocation target discrimination experiment with a harbor porpoise to guide further model development.&lt;/p>
